# Project Noodle!
You're gateway to solving all problems HL2RP related.
I created this project as a loveletter to Half-Life 2 Roleplay 
and what it has to offer. Don't worry! There will be more features,
frameworks, general improvements and much more to come in the future!

# What is noodle?
It's an application designed to install and extract HL2RP frameworks of you're choosing,
all to your desktop, it only takes a few clicks.

# Will there be mod support?
Yes, that is the main intent for this application. We aim to pre-include mods in the frameworks 
so you don't have to go doing all that hard work. Just drag and drop once you're done.
